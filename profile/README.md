## About Clinical Genetics

We investigate genetic disorders at a molecular level in a translational research setting in order to understand disease
mechanisms, apply new knowledge in genetic diagnostics, improve prognosis assessment and develop new treatment
strategies. Our research group consists of four teams and our main interests are hematological malignancies, with a
particular focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, metabolic bone
disorders, and cancer genetics.
